# KidsScanner
Handheld Device for my son to use as a part of a number of games. 

First used to scan for Santa/Reindeer/Elf presence around Christmas, next plan is to write a host of games using RFID tags etc.

Games Ideas:
  - Tag Hide n Seek:
    Hide various RFID Tags, player must find and scan the tags before an alotted time runs out.
    Webserver can allow for setting of the timers and totalling the points awarded for the total scanned.
    
  - Spelling tester
    Webserver will allow for loading of ten words, and chose them in random order for parent to ask.
    Could be ready from a server location to avoid regular inputting.
    
  - Remote control
    Add an IR blaster and a button to allow ON/OFF control over TV or Lights.
    Webserver to allow phones to control TV/Lights remotely.
